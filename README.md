## Working plugin example
![Plugin widgets shown](/images/example.png)

There, you can select the csv output file, and whether or not you want to add the geometry stats for each feature (area, perimeter)

You can also select the option to save a selected feature as a png, based on it's geometric properties

For this example, we select the feature Brazil from the World Map from QGIS, and we save it as the image brazil.png

Output files for this example:

![Brazil geometric properties converted to png](/images/brazil.png)
![Each feature saved on a .csv file](/images/toCsv.png)
